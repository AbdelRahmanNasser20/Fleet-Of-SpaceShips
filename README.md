# Fleet-Of-SpaceShips
AVL Tree

In this fleet every ship carries some specific types of equipment. All ships communicate with each other and at any time all ships are aware of the status of the entire fleet. In this application there is a balanced binary search tree to store the information for all ships. Every node in this BST represents a spaceship.

This project has three classes: Random, Ship, and Fleet. The Random class is provided as a supplementary class to facilitate the testing. The Ship class constitutes the nodes in the binary tree. The Fleet class is the one that implements the balanced binary search tree.
